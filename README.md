#### HMM and Viterbi algorithm with Naive-Bayes classifier in customized features
##### author: Team Goose
##### Goal: implement an HMM model and  a model with customized features to detect metaphor

Information about the program:
It has two programs: model1.py and model2.py; 
One training file 1 trainning data train.csv
One testing file 1 testing data test_no_label.csv in the same directory
Three prediction files pred1.csv from model1 and pred2.csv pred3.csv from model2
One report

###### Run model1.py takes short time 
###### Run model2.py takes tremendous time 

The programs will produce text files called "pred.txt" as the program output

##### Running the program:
---------------------
Option 1: 

	$ python model1.py  
	
Option 2: 

	$ python model2.py
